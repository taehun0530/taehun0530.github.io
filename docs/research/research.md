### Electrochemical Interfaces for Energy Conversion and Storage
<p class="spaced-para">

<span>
My primary focus is to gain a comprehensive understanding of the stability, reactivity, and dynamics of highly efficient (photo)electrodes under operational conditions. I employ an advanced theoretical framework and computational methods to investigate the behavior of (photo)electrochemical systems, specifically in the context of photocatalyst and battery applications. To achieve this, I explore two different scales:
</span>

<span>
(a) Sub-atomic scale: My research involves investigating the charge carrier dynamics at the interface using high-level theory and ab initio molecular dynamics calculations. I focus on understanding the behavior and electronic structures of excess charge carriers, such as excess electrons and holes, in excited states. Additionally, I study the transfer of "hot charge carriers" across interfaces to the electrolyte.
</span>

<span>
(b) Macroscopic scale: In parallel, I employ highly advanced theoretical frameworks (i.e., implict solvation models and machine learning potentials) for electrochemical interfaces. Using methods, I aim to evaluate electrochemical processes at a macroscopic scale or understand ion diffusion behavior (or degradation process) in electrolyte/battery electrodes. In particular, using machine learning potentials molecular dynamics approach, I am interested in the various nanostructures like grain boundaries, vacancy-rich surfaces, and disordered surfaces.

### Defect Physics and Chemistry for Oxides and Organic-inorganic Hybrid Materials
<p class="spaced-para">
</p>

<span>
I am interested in understanding the defect physics and chemistry of metal oxides and (hybrid) perovskites for photocatalyst and photovoltaic applications. My primary focus is on examining the behavior of defects at surfaces, interfaces, as well as in nanostructured or amorphous forms. As first step, I aim to identify stable forms of point defect (or defect complexes) in bulk and at surface/interfaces, while also analyzing their stability and structural properties. To gain insight into how these defects impact the performance of photocatalysts and solar cells, I predict the optical and thermal ionization levels of defects using high-level theory calculations.  Forthermore, charge carrier dynamics at the surface/interface and in nanostructured or amorphous forms is of interest using aiMD calculation. Ultimately, I aim to establish defect engineering rules of those materials at surfaces, interfaces, as well as in nanostructured or amorphous forms that can be applied to enhance the performance of photocatalysts and solar cells.
